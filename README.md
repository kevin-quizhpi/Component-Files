# Component-Files

For storing files for .h, .cpp & .ino files for Components.

Not all files are finalized with all modes considered. Will post updates when needed and available.



## General Advice

-* For use in Arduino constructor with pins used must be declared **outside** setup and loop. 
-* SetPinMode method must be called in setup to set up the component. Becareful with spelling.
